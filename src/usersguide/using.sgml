Below are the steps for starting up using puppet.
</para>

<para>
1) Turning on puppet server. (Only once).
</para>
<screen>
$ su - root
#
###very first time turn on puppet server
###(make sure alt names in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf are as expected)
#
#service puppetmaster status
#chkconfig puppetmaster on
</screen>

<para>
2) Setting nodes to start puppet.
</para>
<screen>
###by default puppet is installed but turned off on compute appliance only.
###(changing default only affect if compute was not installed yet.)
#
#rocks set appliance attr compute attr=Puppet_Client value=True
#
###if nodes already installed (and don't want re-kickstart).
#
#rocks run host compute command='service puppet start'
#rocks run host compute command='chkconfig puppet on'
#
</screen>

<para>
2b) Setting to install and start puppet in other appliances (login for example).
</para>
<screen>
###Set to install puppet in login nodes at kickstart
#
#rocks set appliance attr login attr=Puppet_Client_Install value=True
#
###Set to start puppet at boot on login nodes (after installation)
#
#rocks set appliance attr login attr=Puppet_Client value=True
#
</screen>


<para>
3) Frontend (master puppet) accept clients by 
signing certs submitted by clients.
</para>
<screen>
###Check if clients contacted master (once per kickstart)
#
#puppet cert list
#
###Sign certs, all at once
#
#puppet cert sign --all
#
###Or sign cert individual node
#
#puppet cert sign compute-0-0
#
</screen>

<para>
4)Check puppet install
</para>
<screen>
###install test module
#
#git clone https://github.com/jeramirez/rocks-puppetalive.git /etc/puppet/modules/puppetalive
#
###configure site to use test module
###(by uncommenting /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp)
#
#sed -i -e "s@#include puppetalive@include puppetalive@" /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
#
###(optional)to module take effect immediately restart puppet on nodes
#
#rocks run host compute command='service puppet restart'
#
###check existance of file created my test module
###(test module should create a file /root/puppetalive)
#
#rocks run host compute command='hostname;ls -l /root | grep puppetalive'
#
</screen>
